# Feature-analysis-using-CLIP-model
We want to analyze how well the CLIP model distinguishes between real and synthetic images based on how the model works by extracting and analyzing its feature representa- tions. Using the CLIP zero-shot model we want to investigate how well this image-to-text model can classify images into the 2 classes synthetic and real.
